## Functions

- One of the best tools for following D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding principles
- Blocks of code that perform a specific task, like your phone's features
- Can be reused, helps make program modular and manageable

### Syntax

- Defining a function

```
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Code blocks
        return value
```

- Calling a function

```
    function_name()
```

### Scope

- Children can access parent's scope
- Parents cannot access children's scope

### "return" keyword

- Returns a value from a function
- Also, IMMEDIATELY ENDS THE FUNCTION
- Multiple possible return values (e.g. if/else)

### Arguments and Parameters

- Arguments are values you can pass to the fn
- Parameters are variables that aloows us to pass arguments to our fn
- Positional args: args that are passed to the fn in the correct order
- Default args / optional params: params that assume values if a variable is not assigned (can miss parameters and it still works)
- Keyword args: args that are passed to a fn by explicitly stating the ...? name (order doesn't matter)
